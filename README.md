There are solutions of some interesting code challenges that I found across the net
- Power function (only integer power)
- Letter changes: replace every character in a string with a next character in the alphabet (z -> a) and capitalize every vowel in a result string (works only for the latin alphabet)
- Simple adding
- Factorial
- Alphabet soup
